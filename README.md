# Console Based Calculator Program
 
This is a basic calculator program made in C++. It supports the following operations:

‚úÖ Addition

‚úÖ Subtraction

‚úÖ Multiplication

‚úÖ Division

 Then after the user completes an operation and displays the result. 
 
 It then also saves the calculation history to a text file (Calculations.txt).

The source files will only run on visual studio 2022.

 # Features

 **User Validation**: It ensures that the user only inputs valid data for the calculation.
 
 **Error Handling**: The program checks for devision by 0 and prevents it from crashing.
 
 **File Logging**: After the user does the calculation and get the output it saves it to a txt file (i find this very cool!).

 **Repetition Operation**: After the user finishes his calculation he can do another calculation without exiting the program and reopening it.

 # What i learned

üìÑ File Streaming ‚Äì I learned how to stream data into an external file, allowing users to view their calculation history.

üé® Text Coloring ‚Äì I discovered how to color a specific line of text instead of the entire console, which was useful for alerting users to invalid inputs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling ‚Äì I improved my understanding of error handling in C++, preventing the program from crashing when a user enters a letter or special character instead of an integer.

Think C++ might be my favourite language of all time wonder what i'll make next.
